# Repo Agent Instructions

* Run `npm test` and `npm run build` before committing any changes.
* Documentation can be generated with `npm run docs` which uses TypeDoc and outputs to `docs/`.
* Use TypeScript style consistent with existing code.
* When modifying the repo, suggest updates to `AGENTS.md` and `.cursor/rules` if they would help maintain consistency.
* GitHub Actions run `npm test` on pull requests; verify tests pass locally before pushing.
