# Teleprompter SDK

A TypeScript SDK for interacting with Teleprompter services.

## Scripts

- `npm run build` – compile TypeScript source
- `npm test` – run unit tests
- `npm run docs` – generate TypeDoc documentation to the `docs/` folder

Before generating docs, ensure that a Git remote named `origin` points to the
repository so source links work correctly. You can set this with:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/britt/teleprompter-sdk.git
```

## Development

Install dependencies with `npm install` and then run the scripts above as needed.
