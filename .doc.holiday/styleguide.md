# Documentation Style Guide

## Project Summary

teleprompter-sdk is a TypeScript SDK project that exposes programmatic APIs for interacting with a teleprompter system. The repository contains source TypeScript under src/, tests under src/__tests__ and configuration for TypeDoc documentation generation (typedoc.json). The documentation surface includes a README (project-level overview and usage examples), API documentation produced by TypeDoc, and at least one supplementary doc (AGENTS.md). Intended audience: developers who will install and call the SDK from TypeScript/JavaScript, and contributors who will read source-level API docs. Goals: provide a clear high-level overview and quickstart, demonstrate canonical usage with short code examples, and expose complete API reference generated from TypeScript types via TypeDoc.

## Context

**Project:** teleprompter-sdk
**Description:** No description available
**Publishing System:** TypeDoc

## Primary Documentation Goals

## Writing Rules

### Core Principles
- **Be concise** - Use the minimum words necessary
- **Be practical** - Focus on actionable information
- **Be example-driven** - Show working code for every concept
- **Be consistent** - Match existing documentation patterns

### Tone Guidelines

#### Default Tone (Technical Users)
- Direct and practical language
- Assume familiarity with TypeScript, package managers, CLI
- Use technical jargon and shorthand
- Focus on code examples over explanations
- Avoid marketing language or benefit statements

#### Non-Technical User Adjustments
When explicitly writing for non-technical users:
- Explain what each command does and why
- Spell out abbreviations and technical terms
- Provide simpler code examples with explanations
- Include more step-by-step guidance
- Link to additional learning resources

### Publishing System Requirements
Primary publishing system: TypeDoc (TypeScript API documentation generator). Current repository has no per-page front matter in markdown. To integrate TypeDoc output into a static site or to make pages consumable by site generators that require front matter, do one of the following: 1) enable or configure a TypeDoc Markdown plugin to add front matter automatically (e.g., typedoc-plugin-markdown), or 2) add a small front matter block at the top of README and any hand-written docs (AGENTS.md). Required metadata fields (recommended minimal set for this project):
- title (string) — human readable page title
- description (string) — one-line summary for the page
- sidebar_label (string) — short label for documentation sidebars when applicable
- slug (string) — absolute or root-relative path that will represent the page in the published site
Note: The repository currently uses no metadata; the fields above are not present but are recommended for consistent publishing and sidebar generation.
Exact front matter templates to follow (copy verbatim and paste at top of hand-edited docs files):
---
# Page-level front matter for top-level README and hand-authored docs
title: "teleprompter-sdk"
description: "TypeScript SDK for controlling a teleprompter"
sidebar_label: "teleprompter-sdk"
slug: "/teleprompter-sdk"
---

---
# Page-level front matter for API reference landing page (if adding one manually)
title: "API Reference"
description: "Reference documentation generated by TypeDoc"
sidebar_label: "API"
slug: "/teleprompter-sdk/api"
hide_title: false
---

Typedoc-specific configuration example file (typedoc.json). Add or update this file in repository root to produce Markdown output suitable for static sites (adjust plugin list as needed):
{
  "entryPoints": ["src/index.ts"],
  "out": "docs/api",
  "plugin": ["typedoc-plugin-markdown"],
  "excludePrivate": true,
  "excludeExternals": true,
  "tsconfig": "tsconfig.json"
}

Notes and guidance:
- If using typedoc-plugin-markdown, enable or configure any available frontMatter option in that plugin instead of manual edits so generated pages include consistent metadata.
- All hand-authored pages (README.md, AGENTS.md, contributing docs) must include the front matter block at the top when integrated into a static site that requires it.
- Keep front matter fields in the exact order and names shown above to ensure deterministic behavior in the publishing pipeline.

### Content Structure Rules
General rules
- Always start each doc page with a short purpose statement (1–2 sentences) under the H1.
- For API entry points (README or Quickstart), provide an Installation block, a Quickstart code sample, and a link to API Reference.
- Keep paragraphs short and active-voice.

Technical Documentation Pages (README + reference landing pages)
- 1) Overview & Purpose (H2)
- 2) Installation (H2) — show npm/yarn/pnpm commands
- 3) Quickstart (H2) — minimal runnable TypeScript example that demonstrates the SDK's primary use-case
- 4) Examples (H2) — short, focused examples with subheadings (H3) for each platform or pattern
- 5) API Reference (H2) — link to the TypeDoc-generated docs
- 6) Contributing / Development (H2) — how to run tests, generate docs locally, and submit PRs

API Reference (TypeDoc output)
- Let TypeDoc generate the detailed API docs. Provide a small hand-written landing page (API Reference) that explains how the API docs are organized (modules, classes, interfaces) and points to common entry points.
- When including hand-edited API pages, add brief cross-links to example pages and Quickstart.

Process / Contributor Pages
- Begin with prerequisites.
- Provide step-by-step instructions for tasks such as generating docs:
  - npm run build
  - npm run typedoc (or the exact typedoc command)
- Use numbered lists for ordered steps and code blocks for commands.
- Provide expected output snippets where appropriate.

#### Heading Rules
```markdown
H1 (Single per file)
- Use exactly one H1 per document. This is the page title.
- Example H1s: "# teleprompter-sdk", "# API Reference"
- No trailing punctuation.

H2 (Major sections)
- Use for top-level sections within a page. Use Title Case for headings.
- Example H2s: "## Installation", "## Quickstart", "## API", "## Examples", "## Configuration"

H3 (Subsections)
- Use for breakdowns inside major sections.
- Example H3s: "### Node.js", "### Browser Usage", "### Teleprompter.start(options)"

H4-H6 (Rare usage)
- Use only for very specific technical detail sections, deep API argument descriptions, or long tables of options.
- Example: "#### Option: speed"
```

### Formatting Requirements

#### Lists

- Use bullets for unordered lists
- No periods at end of list items
- Use Oxford comma in series

### Code Example Requirements

1. Always include syntax highlighting with language tags
2. Always include a language tag when adding a code block
3. Show both input and expected output
4. Include comments for complex logic
5. Place runnable example near page top
6. Use codetabs for platform variants

### Linking Rules
Internal Links
- Use relative links from the doc location for files maintained in the repository. For example, from README.md to AGENTS.md use: [Agents](./AGENTS.md)
- For linking into TypeDoc-generated API pages use paths that match the output structure. Example patterns (when using typedoc-plugin-markdown -> docs/api/):
  - Link to a class page: [Teleprompter Class](./api/classes/Teleprompter.md)
  - Link to a method anchor: [Teleprompter.start](./api/classes/Teleprompter.md#start)
- When linking within one page use anchor links with kebab-case for headings. Example: [See Quickstart](#quickstart)

External Links
- Always use the full URL and provide the authoritative label. Example: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- If linking to third-party packages, link to the npm page and the repository as appropriate (provide both when useful): Example: [typedoc-plugin-markdown on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typedoc-plugin-markdown)

Cross-Reference and Navigation Standards
- Prefer linking to higher-level pages from examples (e.g., Quickstart -> API Reference) rather than to low-level symbols unless necessary.
- Use consistent path style for generated API links (choose either ./api/classes/Name.md or /api/classes/Name; keep it consistent across docs).
- Validate links on CI. Add a link-check step to CI to catch broken internal links after refactors.
- When moving or renaming symbols, update both TypeScript exports and any manual links; prefer linking to human-friendly landing pages instead of individual symbol pages when stability is desired.

Examples of exact link syntax to follow
- Relative document link: [Agents](./AGENTS.md)
- Internal section link: [Quickstart](#quickstart)
- TypeDoc generated class link: [Teleprompter.start](./api/classes/Teleprompter.md#start)
- External link: [typedoc-plugin-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typedoc-plugin-markdown)

Link maintenance rules
- Run a link check on all docs as part of CI. Any PR that changes exports, file locations, or major heading text that affects anchors must update links accordingly.
- Prefer link targets that are part of the stable doc surface (README, API landing pages) rather than deep symbol pages that may be more volatile.

### Documentation Content Examples
- Below are examples of existing documentation that you should use for reference, including formatting, structure, layout, style, and language.
- The start and end of the following examples is marked by 10 dashes in a row, like this ----------. The 10 dashes in a row are not part of the formatting or content of the examples.

## Existing Documentation Directory Structure
Repository root
- README.md — Project overview, installation, usage quickstart, and representative code examples. Include the front matter block if your publishing pipeline requires it.
- AGENTS.md — A specialized guide (domain-specific) — treat as hand-authored content; include front matter when publishing.
- LICENSE — License text; no front matter.
- typedoc.json — TypeDoc configuration; required for building API docs. Keep in repo root.
- src/ — Implementation code (TypeScript). Primary entry point: src/index.ts. Keep public exports and documented symbols in src so TypeDoc can discover them.
- src/__tests__/ — Unit tests and example test cases (sample.test.ts). Tests are not part of documentation output but can contain usage examples.

Recommendations for additional doc folders when expanding docs:
- docs/ — place generated API docs and any hand-authored site-specific pages here after generation. Keep a README.md in docs/ with top-level navigation and table of contents for end users.
- docs/examples/ — curated, longer examples and multi-file sample projects.
- docs/contributing.md — contributor guidelines and how to generate docs locally (typedoc build steps).
